This is my resume built based upon a tutorial I followed. It was no easy feat and has caused me to expand my HTML, CSS knowlage into JavaScript, MySQL, and PHP for the full stack.
Since the actual deployment was one of the hardest parts of the build. Not being able to find a good explination of the git build system and all their wonderful offerings. 
This being my first deployment to a server that builds the site instead of just uploading the entire site as a Html and CSS folder.
